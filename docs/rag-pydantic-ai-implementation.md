# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with pydantic-ai: Technical Analysis

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an architecture that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. The approach uses a multi-step process:

1. Retrieval: Find relevant information from a knowledge base based on the query
2. Augmentation: Add this information to the prompt as context
3. Generation: Have the LLM generate a response using both the original query and retrieved context

This approach improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, enables citing sources, and allows updating knowledge without retraining the model.

## Key Components of the Implementation

### Vector Database with pgvector

The implementation uses PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension:

```python
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS doc_sections (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    url text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    title text NOT NULL,
    content text NOT NULL,
    -- text-embedding-3-small returns a vector of 1536 floats
    embedding vector(1536) NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_doc_sections_embedding ON doc_sections USING hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
```

This creates:
- A table for document sections with their content and vector embeddings
- An HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index for efficient similarity search
- A specialized structure optimized for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search

### Embedding Generation

The implementation uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model:

```python
embedding = await context.deps.openai.embeddings.create(
    input=search_query,
    model='text-embedding-3-small',
)
```

This model:
- Creates embeddings with 1536 dimensions
- Is optimized for latency and storage efficiency
- Represents semantic meaning of text in a vector space

### Vector Similarity Search

The similarity search is performed using the `<->` operator to find the most semantically similar documents:

```python
rows = await context.deps.pool.fetch(
    'SELECT url, title, content FROM doc_sections ORDER BY embedding <-> $1 LIMIT 8',
    embedding_json,
)
```

This:
- Computes the L2 (Euclidean) distance between the query embedding and document embeddings
- Orders results by closest match (smallest distance)
- Returns the top 8 most relevant document sections

### pydantic-ai Agent Framework

The implementation leverages pydantic-ai's Agent and tool framework:

```python
@dataclass
class Deps:
    openai: AsyncOpenAI
    pool: asyncpg.Pool

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', deps_type=Deps, instrument=True)

@agent.tool
async def retrieve(context: RunContext[Deps], search_query: str) -> str:
    # Implementation details
```

Key features:
- Dependency injection for providing services to the agent
- Tool registration via decorators
- Context access through RunContext
- Structured message passing between the agent and tools

## Application Flow

1. **Database Building**:
   - Extract document sections from documentation
   - Generate embeddings for each section
   - Store sections and embeddings in the database

2. **Query Processing**:
   - Initialize the agent with dependencies
   - Pass the user question to the agent

3. **Retrieval**:
   - Generate an embedding for the query
   - Find similar document sections using vector similarity
   - Format and return the retrieved sections

4. **Response Generation**:
   - Process the question with the additional context
   - Generate a response that incorporates the retrieved information
   - Return the final answer to the user

## Technical Benefits

1. **Semantic Search**: Finding contextually relevant information beyond keyword matching

2. **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with dependency injection

3. **Extensibility**: Easy to extend with additional tools or knowledge sources

4. **Real-time Information**: Ability to access the latest information without retraining

5. **Transparency**: Sources can be cited, increasing user trust

## Conclusion

This implementation demonstrates a sophisticated RAG system that combines:
- Vector database technology for efficient similarity search
- Modern embedding models for semantic understanding
- A structured agent framework for reliable tool use

The result is an AI system that generates more accurate, reliable, and verifiable responses by effectively leveraging external knowledge.
